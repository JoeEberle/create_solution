## Overview of Create Solution 
The **Create Solution** application streamlines development by generating a customizable solution template, which is then tailored and configured to specific project requirements. Following customization, it seamlessly initiates Git version control and pushes the configured solution to GitHub, ensuring efficient collaboration and version management within the development workflow.

## Process for creating a new solution: 
1. Create solution directory and copies template
2. Generates GITHUB repository 
3. Configures and brands the new solution 
4. Registers the new solution 
5. Creates solution voice over script
6. Generate readme.md documentation file  
7. Creates solution PowerPoint 
8. Generates solution educational video  
9. Publishes to Github
10. Optional - Publishes to Youtube
